## :memo: Description

TieBeNN (**Tie**fen**Be**stimmung mittels **N**euronaler **N**etze) is an event-based wrapper which leverages a number of tools---some machine-learning based, some classic---to automatically produce phase picks for probabilistic hypocenter estimation of local events using [NonLinLoc](http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/).

## :gear: Workflow

Using as input the coordinates (latitude and longitude) and the time of a local event, the seismic event location with TieBeNN goes through the following stages:

1. **Waveform data fetching**: It produces a catalog of stations around the epicenter. Then, waveform data in miniSEED format are retrieved using an ObsPy client on FDSN servers, or from a SDS directory structure.

1. **Waveform data preprocessing**: empty channels are removed, masked channels are split, data are detrended and bandpass filtered. Optionally, stations within 100 km from the epicenter are denoised using the model DeepDenoiser [(Zhu et al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02695).

1. **Phase picking**: P- and S-phases (first arrivals) go through the phase-picking models (either EQTransformer and PhaseNet, as available in the [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench) toolbox) for phase detection.

1. **Phase association**: Phase picks go through phase association to discard possible false detections. The associators available in TieBeNN are [PyOcto](https://github.com/yetinam/pyocto) and [GaMMA](https://github.com/AI4EPS/GaMMA).

1. **Outputs exported**: Event-associated phase picks on each station are exported in a CSV file, including station coordinates, phase arrival time, probability and signal-to-noise ratio. Input files requested by NonLinLoc are generated. Optionally, figures are generated of waveforms and the detected picks at each station, as well as phase association figures.

1. **Probabilistic hypocenter estimation**: The generated files are used for hypocenter estimation with NonLinLoc. Optionally, figures are generated: :one: epicenter and stations with picks in map :two: waveforms with picks, sorted by epicentral distances :three: confidence ellipsoid of event location.

1. **Location quality assessment**: Location metrics are gathered/calculated to generate the Location Quality Score metric, as well as a figure to visualize it. :memo: **A description of this metric will be available in a manuscript, currently in preparation** :memo:

> :point_right: **Note**: When TieBeNN starts, it will go on in a loop until the minimum requested detections within a given epicentral distance are obtained. If this is not the case (there could be several reasons for this), the epicentral distance for station waveform retrieval is gradually increased and the process is repeated. If not enough phase picks are detected within 200 km, the loop breaks and TieBeNN end the run reporting an unsuccessful event location.

## :white_check_mark: Requirements

* **Python 3.9** or a later version. I have sucessfully tested on Python 10 and 12.
* **SeisBench**, the popular seismology toolbox where the machine-learning models required by TieBeNN are stored.
* **NonLinLoc**, the set of programs written in C for probabilistic hypocenter estimation.
* **GMT**, Generic Mapping Tools for map generation.
* **PyGMT**, Python-based GMT wrapper.
* **PyOcto**, phase associator after [MÃ¼nchmeyer (2024)](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1130)
* **Pyrocko**, open-source seismology toolbox and library.
* **GaMMA** phase associator after [Zhu et al.(2022)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JB023249)
* **NLLGrid**, a Python class for reading, plotting and writing NonLinLoc grid files. Hosted [here](https://github.com/claudiodsf/nllgrid).

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

I have tested TieBeNN in Linux Mint (and Lubuntu), so the instructions will use the Debian-based syntax.

It is highly recommended to use a *virtual environment* to install software with several requirements. We select the folder where we will install the virtual environment (do not forget to replace the names between angle brackets for what you choose):

```
python3 -m venv <path_to_virtual_environment>/<venv_tiebenn>
```

Then, we must activate the virtual environment:

```
source <path_to_virtual_environment>/<venv_tiebenn>/bin/activate
```
> :bulb: **TIP**
>
> You can create a shortcut in your _.bashrc_ file to quickly access the virtual environment in future runs. Open _.bashrc_ with your favorite editor (e.g. `nano ~/.bashrc`) and add the following line at the end of the file:
>
> `alias <alias_name>='source <path_to_virtual_environment>/<venv_tiebenn>/bin/activate'`
>
> Replace `<alias_name>` for something convenient. Then, reset the command line:
> `exec bash`

> for changes to take effect. To activate your virtual environment, just type `<alias_name>` in the command line.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Installing Python dependencies

Installing SeisBench will install most of Tiebenn's dependencies. You can install a pure-CPU version of SeisBench, in case it is necessary. For this, after activating the virtual environment by using the previously created alias, type:

```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install seisbench
```

If you are working on a GPU machine, then you can skip the first line and directly install SeisBench with the second line. Then, you can proceed with the installation of the remaining dependencies:

```
pip install pygmt pyocto pyrocko nllgrid
pip install git+https://github.com/wayneweiqiang/GaMMA.git 
```

Go to the desired directory where you wish to run Tiebenn and clone the repository:

```
git clone https://gitlab.szo.bgr.de/dzreorg/software/tiebenn.git
```

### :hammer_and_wrench: Installing NonLinLoc and setting paths

NonLinLoc must be individually compiled to make sure it is compatible with the machine where TieBeNN will be running. First we will create the directory `<tiebenn_directory>/utils/nonlinloc` and within it, we clone the NonLinLoc repository:

```
mkdir <tiebenn_directory>/utils/nonlinloc
cd <tiebenn_directory>/utils/nonlinloc

git clone https://github.com/ut-beg-texnet/NonLinLoc.git
```
> :exclamation: **Important**
>
> Do not just download NonLinLoc's "last version", as it has bugs which have been fixed within the code, but not yet been added to a new, updated version.

We will compile NonLinLoc in the `src` directory and copy the required programs for depth estimation in the `<tiebenn_directory>/utils/nonlinloc` directory:

```
cd NonLinLoc/src
mkdir bin
cmake .
make
cd bin
cp Vel2Grid* Grid2* NLLoc ../../../
```

The last step is to set the path, so we can run NonLinLoc from any directory:

```
nano ~/.bashrc

export PATH=${PATH}:<tiebenn_directory>/utils/nonlinloc/
exec bash
```

### :hammer_and_wrench: Install GMT

According to the offical website of PyGMT, a GMT version 6.4.0 or later is needed in order to run PyGMT correctly. However, I have tested with GMT 6.0 and it works, at least for the few commands needed by TieBeNN. I would recommend version >= 6.0 to be on the safe side. [The official GMT documentation](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/dev/install.html) has installation instructions, including instructions to migrate from earlier versions, and of course, a bunch of tutorials.

## :test_tube: Usage

This section shows an example which should make TieBeNN's usage clear.

### :inbox_tray: Input file

TieBeNN needs an input file with the epicenter and the datetime (UTC) of the event to be located. The structure must be as follows: `datetime  latitude  longitude`. Accepted datetime formats are: `dd-Mon-yyyy hh:mm:ss`, `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`, or `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`.

A concrete example would be:

```
2024-12-24T01:55:04 51.337  12.548
```
with any extra information after those values (e.g. depth, magnitude...) being ignored.

### :receipt: Syntax

With the virtual environment activated (see above), TieBeNN follows this syntax:

```
python tiebenn.py --event_file <EventFile> --max_epic_dist <MaxEpDist> --picker <Picker> --client <Client> --min_detections <MinDetections> --plots <Plots> --vel_mode <VelMode> --ph_assoc <PhaseAssoc> --denoise <Denoise> --mult_windows <MultiWindows>
```

| Parameter | Description |
|:----------|:-----------:|
| **EventFile** | Input file with preliminary epicenter (latitude, longitude) and UTC datetime |
| **MaxEpDist** | Maximum epicentral distance (in km) for stations on which phase picks will be detected |
| **Picker** | Select model for phase picking. **EQTransformer** can be defined as `sb_eqt`, `seisbench_eqt`, `seisbench_eqtransformer`, `sb_eqtransformer` and **PhaseNet** as `sb_pn`, `seisbench_pn`, `sb_phasenet`, `seisbench_phasenet`. Not case sensitive |
| **Client** | If set to `SDS`, it will access the directory with SeisComp3 structure, which must be defined in `tools/sb_tools.py`, line 86. It will try to fetch waveforms from the stations in the station list within `MaxEpDist`. It will then try to fetch stations using FDSN clients to access their services. If set to `FDSN`, it skips the search for a SDS directory |
| **MinDetections** | Minimum amount of stations on which P- or S- phase picks must be detected for the loop to end |
| **Plots** | If set to True, it will plot the waveform recorded on each stations with at least one phase detection. It will also plot all the phase picks associated to the event sorted by epicentral distance and plots of the locations: epicenter and stations with detections on a map, waveforms with phase picks sorted by epicentral distance, and confidence ellipsoid of event location |
| **VelMode** | |
| **PhaseAssoc** | |
| **Denoise** | |
| **MultWindows** | |
