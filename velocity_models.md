# Velocity models implemented in TieBeNN

This is a list of the velocity models currently implemented in TieBeNN. As further local, dedicated velocity models are published/discovered, they can be integrated in TieBeNN.

| 7 | Crust1.0 + AK135, the Crust1.0 model is used for the crustal structure and the lower continental structure from AK135 is merged immediately below |

|12 | 3D model for Central Alps (Diehl et al. 2021) _Note_: I am not sure I implemented this model correctly in NonLinLoc and 3D velocity models are currently deactivated |

|18 | PO1, 1D P- and S-velocity model for the Novy-Kostel earthquake swarm region, constrained models [(Malek et al. 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00024-023-03250-w). Model defined down to 11 km depth |
|19 | PO1 (Malek et al. 2023) + WB2012 from 11 km depth |

When using `--vel_mode manual` the parameter `velmod` will be defined as the number assigned to the desired model. When the **Crust1.0** model is selected, the velocities in the layers at the epicenter are utilized to create a 1D velocity structure.

## Structure of NonLinLoc velocity structure files

Each layer uses one line in the text file defining the velocity models. These lines follow the NonLinLoc control file syntax:

````text
LAYER   DepthKm   VelP   GradVelP   VelS   GradVelS   Dens   GradDens
````

- `VelP`, `VelS` in km/s; `GradVelP`, `GradVelS` are the linear velocity gradients in km/s/km
- `Dens` in kg/m^3, `GradDens`: linear density gradient in kg/m^3/km

> :exclamation: **Note**
> The density is a carry over in the layer format from its original use in a waveform modelling code. It is not used in the NonLinLoc programs, so any convenient numerical value can be used.

## Add a new 1D velocity model

To add a new 1D velocity model in TieBeNN, you need to create a text file in the directory `<tiebenn_directory>/utils/velocity_models`. The file must named `v_<number_assigned>`
